# Advent of Code 2022 - Day 03
This is my solution for [Advent of Code 2022 - Day 03](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/3). The problem involves parsing a text file which contains Strings, and then checking either two or three Strings at a time to find the character which is duplicated across all the Strings. We then sum up the 'priority' (or ASCII number) of those characters to arrive at the solution.

The solution I have written involves simply checking nested if conditions - it is certainly not particularly efficient but simple enough for the number of inputs we receive.
