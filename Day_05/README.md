# Advent of Code 2022 - Day 05
This is my solution for [Advent of Code 2022 - Day 05](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/5). This is the first point during the challenge where I wanted to spend a little bit more time and make my solution more reusable, using a more 'object-oriented' approach. The result is only half-complete however - this solution still needs more time to be fully clean and robust. The solution also needs accessor and mutator methods etc. to be fully complete.

This problem involves parsing input from a text file which instructs a crane on a cargo dock to pick up and move around crates. Because the crates are picked up and moved on top of other stacks of crates, using stacks in the implementation seemed fairly natural.
