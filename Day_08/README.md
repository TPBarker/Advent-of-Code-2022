# Advent of Code 2022 - Day 08
This is my solution for [Advent of Code 2022 - Day 08](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/8). The problem involves parsing a text file which contains a grid of numbers which represent trees of varying heights. We need to then solve a few problems, such as calculating how many trees are 'visible' when looking from the outside of the grid in, and how many trees are visible when standing at the top of each tree.

My solution creates an array of Integers to represent the grid of trees and then uses conditionals and loops to check through and solve for each part of the problem.
