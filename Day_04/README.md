# Advent of Code 2022 - Day 04
This is my solution for [Advent of Code 2022 - Day 04](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/4). This problem involves parsing input from a text file to obtain Strings which contain "number ranges" (e.g. 32-54, 21-58 etc.). Then we perform several checks on these number ranges and count the number of ranges which 1. overlap and 2. are contained completely within each other.

My solution simply uses a complicated conditional statement - perhaps not the most legible or 'clean' solution in terms of code quality, but a very easy implementation.
