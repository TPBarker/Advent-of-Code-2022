# Advent of Code 2022 - Day 06
This is my solution for [Advent of Code 2022 - Day 06](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/6). This problem involves checking a very long String to find the first occurence of a unique set of characters (part one: a set of four unique characters, part two: a set of fourteen unique characters). My part one solution uses a simple 'brute force' conditional to check for unique characters. My part two solution, however, uses a HashMap to check for uniqueness and is a much more elegant solution.
